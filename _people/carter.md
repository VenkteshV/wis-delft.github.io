## About

Too often, we feel like technology has a hold of us, rather than using it to live the lives we value. In my research (Personal Values in Design), I explore how we can design technology in a manner that empowers us and puts us back in the driver's seat. In particular, I look at how we can design systems to help us make more value-centered decisions when interacting with technology. To do this, I take insights from philosophy concerning human autonomy and translate them into design criteria, taking cues from other disciplines such as the psychology of decision-making, human-computer interaction, and value-sensitive design.

In my current role as a Postdoc in AI Ethics at TU Delft (funded by the Dutch National Digital Society Program), I conduct research into promoting human autonomy through mental health chatbot design. I also organize events to bring together diverse scholars to explore meaningful human-AI interaction, and I greatly enjoy teaching, supervising, and mentoring students in ethics. 

Having grown up in the North Woods of Minnesota, I am passionate about nature and enjoy birding, hiking, and taking long walks. I also am a hobbyist upright and electric bass player, playing jazz, blues, rock, and classical music.
