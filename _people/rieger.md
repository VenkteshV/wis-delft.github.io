## About
I am a PhD candidate in the Web Information Systems group and an Early Stage Researcher in the [NL4XAI](https://nl4xai.eu/) project, supervised by Sole Pera.
Before coming to TU Delft, I obtained my BSc and MSc degree in cognitive science and human-machine interaction from Chemnitz University of Technology. 
Currently, my research is focused on understanding web search on debated topics and mitigating cognitive biases that impede responsible opinion formation, for example, by boosting searchers' intellectual humility.
