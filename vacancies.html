                        Artificial Intelligence is used more and more in society, from healthcare to government decisions and recruitment. 
                        Along with the rapid increase of AI adoption come increased concerns about the inherent shortcomings of such 
                        technologies (e.g., robustness) and the social, and ethical implications. To create AI systems that can properly serve humans, 
                        it is crucial to put humans at the centre of the process such that the outcome system behaves in a way that fits the values and 
                        needs of people. This poses new challenges both to philosophical work on values and to (responsible) technological development. 
                        What (ethical) requirements should these systems adhere to? What does such ‘adherence’ mean and how can we demonstrate and 
                        validate claims regarding adherence? How to build AI systems that can be understood by humans and that can align their behaviour 
                        with human values? Tackling these challenges requires bridging the gap between philosophy and computer science within AI Ethics.<br> 
                    </p>
                    <p>     
                        TU Delft has world-leading expertise in the operationalization of AI Ethics and now looks to strengthen this by hiring two 
                        three-year post-docs, one in philosophy and one in computer science, that will be closely collaborating on topics within 
                        AI Ethics of their choice.

                        <strong>Summary:</strong> We are searching for a motivated postdoctoral researcher to lead the
                        research and development of dataset discovery and data augmentation tools using ML techniques.
                        You will be working alongside a team of excellent PhD & MSc students, and taking part in funding

                        <strong>Details:</strong>
                        Data-driven enterprises nowadays need to discover, combine and analyze data at the petabyte
                        scale. Data discovery aims at finding a subset of relevant datasets from a data lake that can be
                        combined together and enable deep insights to a given question. Dataset discovery is one of the
                        most intensively discussed data management challenges for big data. The current approaches
                        mostly search for datasets with similar attribute names or overlapping instance values, handling
                        tabular data or hierarchical data that can be transformed into tabular data. The challenges
                        include finding joinable tables or semantically related tables. As part of the Web Information
                        Systems (WIS) section, the

                        validation, and feature engineering.
